# devRantSwiftUI
An unofficial devRant client written in SwiftUI and UIKit for mobile Apple devices.

Note: this is app is VERY early and a work in progress. Currently, it is not intended for casual use, even though I am constantly adding more and more functionality to it.

# Project Preparation for Building/Self-use
```
git clone https://github.com/OmerFlame/devRantSwiftUI && cd devRantSwiftUI
pod install
```

Then, open the **workspace** file (not the project file), then let the Swift Package Manager do its thing automatically. Then, you can do what you intended to do.
